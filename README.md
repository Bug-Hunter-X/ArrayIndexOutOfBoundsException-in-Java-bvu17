# ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in Java

This repository demonstrates a common Java error: the `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.  The code attempts to access an array element using an index that is greater than or equal to the array's length or less than zero.  This can lead to unexpected program termination.

The solution demonstrates how to handle potential index issues by checking the index value before accessing the array element.  This technique prevents unexpected exceptions and makes the code more robust.
